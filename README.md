Creating a website to host and present your interactive HTML plot is a great way to share it with others. Here's a simple guide to get you started:

### Step 1: Choose a Hosting Platform

1. **GitHub Pages**: If you have a GitHub account, you can use GitHub Pages to host static websites for free.
2. **Netlify**: Another popular option for hosting static sites, with easy deployment from a GitHub repository.
3. **Vercel**: Similar to Netlify, it offers free hosting for static sites and easy integration with GitHub.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Files

1. **HTML File**: You already have the `dp_inlet_vs_outlet_scatter_mobile.html` file.
2. **Index File**: Rename your HTML file to `index.html` or create a new `index.html` that links to your plot file.

### Step 3: Deploy Your Site

#### Using GitHub Pages

1. **Create a Repository**: Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. **Upload Files**: Upload your `index.html` file to the repository.
3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to the repository settings.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Select the branch (usually `main`) and the folder (usually `/root`) to serve the site from.
   - Save the settings, and GitHub will provide a URL for your site.

#### Using Netlify

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account on Netlify.
2. **New Site from Git**: Connect your GitHub account and select the repository.
3. **Deploy**: Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site.
4. **Custom Domain**: You can set up a custom domain if desired.

#### Using Vercel

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account on Vercel.
2. **Import Project**: Connect your GitHub account and select the repository.
3. **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically build and deploy your site.
4. **Custom Domain**: You can set up a custom domain if desired.

### Step 4: Share Your Site

Once your site is live, you can share the URL with anyone, and they can access your interactive plot from any device with a web browser.

### Additional Tips

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure your HTML is responsive so it looks good on all devices.
- **Security**: If your plot contains sensitive data, consider who you share the link with.
- **Updates**: You can update your plot by pushing changes to your GitHub repository, and the hosting service will automatically update the site.

This approach provides a simple and effective way to share your interactive plots with a wider audience. If you have any questions or need further assistance with any of these steps, feel free to ask!
